This is the door opener prototype for "Aurora Project", a collaboration between me, [Andres Reynoso](https://github.com/AndresReyMaz), and [Jorge Beauregard](https://github.com/jorgebeauregard), as well as up to 7 additional collaborators.

Aurora is the codename for a working space administration system, that aims to regulate the use of said spaces for offices and schools. This system is composed of three components: Hardware, Front-End and Back-End. This respository covers the Hardware part of the system.

In order to replicate the functionality of the system, it is required to have all three components running. The hardware needed can be checked out at the circuit diagrams included.
